Beneficiaries will be able to log in and log out to the application using their email and password. It will also give a registration form for beneficiaries who want to apply to be a member of the educational support program. Student who are currently enrolled in the program can change their status by simply renewing their participation using the application. They will be the ones who can verify the status of the beneficiaries and change their records.
